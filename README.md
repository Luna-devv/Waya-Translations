**ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow Humans**

## **__Translations__**
With the last update, [@Waya#0325](https://waya.one) got support for multi langauges. <br />
Inside of this repo, you will be able to find all language files for all translations. <br />

#### Get started
If you want to translate into a new language or fix translations, **__please not the following**__:<br />
1. Never ever replace placeholders with `{}` (i.e.: `{name}`), since these will get replaced later in the code.<br />
2. The files need to have the same JSON object, which means you should never edit the key value of the JSON.<br />
3. The files need to have the same name as the original one, `[type].[command].js` (e.i.: `interaction.config.js`).<br />
4. The folder name should be always the language code (i.e.: `en/`, `jp/`).

#### Keep on topic
For discussions about Translations, **please use [#ãƒ»developers](https://waya.one/go/discord)**, <br />
use the repository only to submit/update texts! Thank you!
