# Translations
ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow Humans

I am updating [@Waya#0325](https://waya.one) to support multiple languages.. <br />
So what does that mean to you? It means that you can translate texts __with the template__ that I'll always post here, you **should never** change the first row of the JSON data. 

### Know your languages! 
Please note that you should be able to 
know English and the language you want to translate into.

# Submission

For submission, please got to the github.com repository and fork the it, <br />
in your fork you can take changes, if you **open a pull request**, <br />
please **note all changes** you have made (in the pull request template). <br />
Thank you!

# Keep on topic
